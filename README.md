# 🃏 Blackjack Python

**Blackjack Python** is a simple command-line game that simulates the classic casino card game **Blackjack**. This project was developed to practice Python fundamentals such as **functions, loops, conditionals, and user interaction** while implementing basic game logic.

## 🚀 Features

- **🎲 Randomized Card Dealing** – Draws cards from a simulated deck.  
- **💡 Hand Value Calculation** – Includes Ace handling (11 or 1).  
- **🙈 Hidden Dealer Card** – The dealer's first card is hidden until the round ends.  
- **🤔 User Decision-Making** – Allows the player to hit or stand.  
- **🏆 Win/Loss Conditions** – Compares hands and determines the winner.  
- **🔄 Play Again Option** – The game loops until the player decides to quit.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Concepts Used**: Functions, Loops, Conditionals, User Input  

## 📂 Project Structure

- `app.py` – Controls the game flow, handles user interactions, and determines game outcomes.  
- `functions.py` – Contains helper functions for dealing cards, calculating hand values, and asking for user input.
